# XcodeHeaders
Runtime headers of all the Xcode shared frameworks to aid plugin development.

The current dump is of Xcode 7.3 (7D175)

`xcode-dump.sh` script is included to aid in dumping all the the framework headers. You'll need to edit this script and point it to your location of `class-dump`.

If you don't have `class-dump` it's available at http://stevenygard.com/projects/class-dump/.
